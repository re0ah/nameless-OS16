# nameless-OS16

## How build & start?
Just load repository, download quemu, make, mkisofs and nasm, go to directory of project and write "sudo make run".

## Philosophy
Write on assembly and feel pain.

## For what?
Killing time. Course work, thesis. Also, having site on django. And this site is my exam. Conveniently, right? https://github.com/re0ah/nameless_os_site
